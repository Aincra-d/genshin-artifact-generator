			Genshin Impact Artifact Generator is a hobby project of mine, which is the result of me loving Genshin Impact, and having programming knowledge with too much free time on my hands.

			<br><br>

			Originally it was just a small and low-effort project, where I was playing with the random generator, randomly generating main and sub stats.

			<br>

			For example, believe it or not, this was the state of this app back in December 2020.

			<img style="width:100%" src="/rolls-1.jpg" alt="State of app - 2020">

			Then as I was messing around with it, I thought I would make it a bit more detailed, so I started storing the values of each stat, then started adding pictures to them, and it started becoming kinda usable already, but still was nowhere near the current state.

			<br>

			Then I realized there is no such thing as artifact generator out there yet, even though we have/had multiple wish simulator, damage calculator, farming calculator etc.

			<br>

			So I decided to give it a shot, and make that mess you see above into something usable, and what you see now is the result of the sometimes hard, sometimes not-so-hard work of months.
